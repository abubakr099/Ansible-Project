# Ansible Server Management and Deployment

## Overview
This repository contains Ansible playbooks and configurations for managing servers and deploying applications. Ansible is an open-source automation tool that allows you to automate configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.

## Ansible Introduction
Ansible is a simple, agentless automation tool that uses SSH to manage and configure servers. It allows you to automate tasks such as:
- Provisioning servers
- Configuring software and services
- Deploying applications
- Managing infrastructure as code

## Features
- **Server Management**: Ansible can be used to automate server setup, configuration, and maintenance tasks across multiple servers.
- **Application Deployment**: Ansible playbooks can automate the deployment of applications, making it easy to ensure consistency across environments.
- **Task Automation**: Ansible can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time for more important work.

## Getting Started
To get started with Ansible, follow these steps:
1. Install Ansible on your control machine.
2. Configure your inventory file (`hosts`) to define the servers you want to manage.
3. Write Ansible playbooks to define the tasks you want to automate.
4. Run Ansible commands or playbooks to execute tasks on your servers.

## Ansible Commands
Here are some common Ansible commands:

- **ansible**: Run ad-hoc commands on remote servers.
  ```bash
  ansible all -m ping
  ansible-playbook deploy.yml
ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml
